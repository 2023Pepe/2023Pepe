- 👋 Hi, I’m @2023Pepe
- 👀 I’m interested in learning a post-retirement skill where I can work remotely from anywhere. I am hope to retire in the next 6-8 months. Yes, I am that old.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ from Codecademy. I am also hoping to enroll in Comm. College CIS AS degree this fall. If not, I guess Winter session will do.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner projects where I can practice my coding. I've also taken HTML, and Javascript courses, but need to practice more.
- 📫 You can reach me at balm06_swats@icloud.com.
